# SP-AGI — Sovereign Personal AGI (Notes)

This repository contains an open exploration of the SP-AGI idea
(Sovereign Personal Artificial General Intelligence).

SP-AGI is explored here as a personal, lifelong AI agent concept that
grows with an individual and acts in the interest of that person,
with strong boundaries around autonomy, consent, and privacy.

This is not a product, company, or startup.
It is a thinking and learning exploration, shared openly.
